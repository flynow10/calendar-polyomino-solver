# Calendar Polyomino Solver

I worked with my [Dad](https://github.com/ogcopilot) on this mini project experimenting with solving polyomino problems. We were specifically focused on the [praxis puzzles](https://praxispuzzles.com/calendar_puzzle_rhombus) calendar rhombus puzzle. After messing around with some naive brute force solutions, we settled on a typescript implementation of Donald Knuth's Algorithm X based on his original paper [Dancing Links](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047).
